            <h2>Will joining a fraternity affect my academic performance?</h2>
            <p>Yes, in order to be eligible to join a fraternity, a student must have a minimum GPA of 2.5.
               Academics are very important to the fraternity community and due to this,
              every organization must provide help to their members should they struggle
            to maintain this minimum.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <input type="checkbox" checked>
            <i></i>
            <h2>I've heard about hazing in fraternities. Does that happen?</h2>
            <p>No, hazing does not happen in RPI fraternities. We are fully committed to 
              providing a safe, welcoming, and respectful environment for all members. 
              We strictly adhere to the policies and laws that prohibit hazing, both 
              from RPI Policy and the local and federal laws. Hazing is not only illegal 
              but is counterproductive to our goal of fostering brotherhood and personal 
              development.</p>

            <h2>What are the financial obligations of joining a fraternity?</h2>
            <p>Joining a fraternity does come with financial obligations, but these costs 
              often provide significant value.
              The fees typically cover membership dues, social events, and philanthropy 
              projects, among other things. Notably, the room and board expenses 
              are generally more affordable than those offered by RPI.
            Specific financial obligations vary by chapter; students are encouraged to 
            ask individual organizations should they wish to know more.</p>

            <h2>What leadership opportunities are available within the fraternity system?</h2>
            <p>Leadership opportunities within the fraternity system abound at both the 
              chapter and council levels. At the chapter level, members can serve in roles
               like President or Treasurer, influencing the direction and success of the 
               fraternity. Council leadership roles allow for broader impact within the 
               fraternity community, shaping initiatives that benefit all chapters. These 
               positions provide valuable experiences in teamwork, communication, and 
               strategic thinking, enhancing both your fraternity experience and future 
               professional endeavors.</p>

            <h2>How can I balance fraternity commitments with my academic and personal life?</h2>
            <p>Balancing fraternity commitments with academic and personal life is entirely
               possible with proper time management and prioritization. Being part of a 
               fraternity means joining a supportive community that values academics and 
               personal well-being. Many chapters offer study sessions, academic 
               resources, and mentorship to help you succeed academically. Clear 
               communication with fraternity leadership about your needs and setting 
               realistic expectations can further ensure a healthy balance.</p>

            <h2>What opportunities does the fraternity provide for personal growth and development?</h2>
            <p>The fraternity provides diverse opportunities for personal growth and 
              development that extend beyond social connections. Through involvement 
              in chapter leadership, council roles, philanthropic projects, and community 
              service, members can cultivate essential life skills such as leadership, 
              teamwork, communication, and empathy. Engaging in these opportunities not
               only enriches the college experience but fosters a well-rounded individual 
               ready to succeed in life beyond university.</p>
